# mongodb_export

A simple script to export all data from Mongo DB. Can be used both separately and as a part for something more serious :).

Before working, edit the data to access your database, DB name, collection name and file for save (example in the script). 

Before running the script you need to install the library pymongo.

```
pip install pymongo
```

Run with a simple command:

```
python main.py
```
